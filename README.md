# NGFF RFC-8 JSON Schemas

JSON Schemas and validation tools for NGFF RFC-8 collections - see https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/rfc/8/index.html.

> **WARNING**: This project is a proof of concept. It is experimental, unstable, and not intended for production use.

## JSON Schemas

Schema files are available in the [`schemas` folder](./schemas).

## Python package

The `ngff-rfc8` Python package contains the static JSON Schema files, and it exposes a simple validation function and a command-line interface.

A library-usage example looks like
```python
from ngff_rfc8.validate import validate_collection

data = {
    "ome": {
        "version": "0.x",
        "type": "collection",
        "name": "My Collection",
        "id": "some-collection-id",
        "attributes": {},
        "nodes": [],
    }
}
validate_collection(data)
```
while a command-line-interface example looks like
```bash
ngff-rfc-8-validate /some/collection.json
```
(from a Python environment where the package is installed).

## JavaScript

(in progress)

## Development

Python:
```bash
# Init
uv venv
uv sync --all-groups

# Run tests
uv run pytest python/tests

# Generate single-file JSON Schema
uv run python3 python/scripts/build_single_schema.py > ngff-rfc8.json
```
